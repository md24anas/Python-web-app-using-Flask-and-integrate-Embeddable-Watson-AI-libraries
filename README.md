In this project, we make use of the embedded Watson AI libraries, to create an application that would perform sentiment analysis on a provided text. Then deploy the application over the web using Flask framework.

Embeddable Watson AI libraries include the NLP library, the text-to-speech library and the speech-to-text library.
The NLP library includes functions for sentiment analysis, emotion detection, text classification, language detection, etc. among others. The speech-to-text library contains functions that perform the transcription service and generates written text from spoken audio.
